# PointsCore
An open- and (hopefully) easy to use API for a neat point system in Minecraft Servers

The PointsCore plugin aims to create a nice and easy to use api for a brand new point system in minecraft. It abstracts all tools and weapon types, and
based on their usage, adds a configurable amount of points to each user. In the future, I plan to create a cryptocurrency to allow players to actually
be paid out in real money. This will be linked to this points plugin, in order to redeem real-life rewards.

Furthermore, a secondary plan with this plugin is to re-create the "UpgraeableTools" plugin with more addded functionality and an optional additional jar
For custom enchantments which allows a player to upgrade his tools based on the points that the player has accumulated for that particular tool. 

Lastly the plan with points core is to allow server owners to have a new kind of economy system that rewards players for actively playing on your server.
This is due to the fact that they will have to use their tools and thus will be able to earn points this way.

The possibilities are endless with this plugin and hopefully will be adopted by many devs and server owners in the future. Seen as this is a huge project
I will require a lot of assistance in it. Therefore if you are a developer, and are interested in working with me on this huge plan, feel free to write
to me on discord in a dm and i'll be sure to add you to the list of contributors.

Thanks for reading, I hope this plugin will bring some good to the spigot community.
